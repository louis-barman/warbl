## The WARBL TESTS.

These WARBL tests can be run on a PC and allow code to be developed and debugged without needing to run the code on a WARBL.

These test should work with any c++ compiler that that is suport by `cmake`
and uses GoogleTest as the test runner.
See https://google.github.io/googletest/

CMAKE and GoogleTest should be compatiable Visual Studio for windows.
